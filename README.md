# POW Test Task

A test task for a Frontend Engineer

## Overview

You need to develop a textarea component according to the design in Figma: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/uXFo7cFpM0u6Qu1uZhvYet/POW-test-task?node-id=0-1&t=WmuHeNEZUacsluZz-1).

The textarea can work in two variants:
- Waiting for a text answer from the bot
- Waiting for an image generation answer

After the user submits the request, it is expected to receive some constant mock dataâ€”either text or an image, depending on the request.
Concentrate only on textarea behavior, you don't need to focus on bot answers.

## Tech Stack

- SvelteKit
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

You can use this action to resize the textarea: [Textarea Autosize Action](https://svelte-legos.surge.sh/guides/actions/textareaAutosizeAction/).

## Bonus (Optional). You can skip this subtask.

It would be great if you use a state machine (XState - [XState Documentation](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate)) in your app. The textarea field should have the following four states:
- IDLE state
- Loading data
- Chat bot is typing or generating an image


## Deliverables
Feel free to use any chatbot you know. The main purpose is to understand how you can use Svelte and your ability to deploy your code.

As a result, please provide:
- The link to the deployed app
- The link to the repository with the code

Good luck!
